## Project Goals

Low-level program drivers from scratch, and use them to develop a game that runs on Minix Operating System.
This game is inspired by the famous game Pictionary.
We use a layered architecture, as we call modules and made some things we're proud of which you can find in the [report document](doc/report.pdf).
